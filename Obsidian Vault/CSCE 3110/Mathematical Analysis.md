* **Use math to estimate the running time of an algorithm**
	* Almost always dependent on the size of the input
	* Algorithm1 running time is n^2 for an input of size n
	* Algorithm2 running time is n x log(n) for an input size n
* **Pros:**
	* Formal, rigorous
	* No need to implement algorithms
	* machine-independent
* **Cons:**
	* Math knowledge
