* Steps:
	* Implement an algorithm in a given programming language
	* Measure runtime with several inputs
	* Infer running time for any input
* Pros:
	* No math, straightforward method
* Cons:
	* Not reliable, heavily dependent on
		* The sample inputs
		* programming language and environment
* We want to analyze algorithms to decide whether they are worth implementing
